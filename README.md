## React Router Deliverable

1. Your assignment is to make a personal website that looks like this:<br><br>
![Example](myAwesomeWebsite.png)

1. It should have five pages:

        Home

        My blog

        About moi

        Favorite Movies

        Favorite Food


1. Each page should be a component. 

1. Create a navigation menu of list items that Route to each page. 

1. On the "Favorite Movies" page, use the attached favoriteMovies.js to display content for these movies:

        Shazam

        Captain Marvel

        Escape Room 

        How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World

        Glass

        Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Treasure Island

        Dumbo

        Avengers: Infinity War

1. Clicking on one of these links should display

        Overview

        Release Date

        Poster
1. The other pages don't need to have much content â€” just the header at the top saying what the page is and a paragraph description of your choosing.
